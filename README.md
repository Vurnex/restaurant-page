# Pizza Restaurant Page
Restaurant page project for the Odin Project. The purpose of the project is to practice the usage of webpack. Also to practice rendering page content through JavaScript. 

## What I Learned
- Usage of webpack
- Render page content exclusively through JavaScript
- Create re-usable components
- Selecting a dynamic element or an element after it has been added to the DOM using JavaScript.

## Challenges I Faced
- Getting content to show up while using JavaScript
- Showing tabbed page specific content on tab click
